# Network_Anomaly_Detection_Project
> An anomaly detection system for identifying unusual network behavior using machine learning algorithms in Python. . This project offers an end-to-end approach to network anomaly detection, starting with data exploration and visualization in Tableau, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, machine learning modeling with experimental tracking, and concluding with deployment.

# Problem Statement
> In the realm of cybersecurity, network anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from the norm within network traffic. These anomalies could signify a range of security threats, from compromised devices and malware infections to large-scale cyber-attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service).

> So assume you are working as a data scientist with cyber security department. You are provided with the Networking data (NSL-KDD dataset). Your task is to visualise and analyse the given data. Apply Supervised Learning algorithms to find the best model which can classify the data using attack column. Unsupervised algorithms can be used to improve the performance. Finally deploy the machine learning models via Streamlit.

# Target Metric
The primary metric for this project is the accuracy of the model in correctly classifying network anomalies. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also evaluated to ensure balanced performance across different classes.
